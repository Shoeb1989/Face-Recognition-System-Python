# In This Project,

• First, look at a picture and find all the faces in it

• Second, focus on each face and be able to understand that even if 
  a face is turned in a weird direction or in bad lighting, it is still the 
  same person.
  
• Third, be able to pick out unique features of the face that you can 
  use to tell it apart from other people— like how big the eyes are, 
  how long the face is, etc.
  
• Finally, compare the unique features of that face to all the people 
  you already know to determine the person’s name
